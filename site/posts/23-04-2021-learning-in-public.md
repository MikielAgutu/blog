Hello, my name's Mikiel. I'm the technical lead for the [Flyway Team](https://flywaydb.org/) at Redgate.

I've started this blog in an effort to '[Learn In Public](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1009174159690264579)'. I hope what I write might be useful to you.

At Redgate, every Friday afternoon we're encouraged to take '10% time' - a chance to pursue personal development and learning. I plan to use this blog to chart my learnings throughout 10% time, and beyond.

So I welcome you to join me on this journey! I hope you find something interesting here.

Thanks

Mikiel
